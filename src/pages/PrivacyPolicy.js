        About me I am sole trader and data controller of the information I hold
        and process about individuals who have expressed an interest in my
        hypnotherapy service. About the individuals whose data I collect I
        collect data about individuals who: • Enquire about and/or attend
        hypnotherapy sessions • Enquire about and/or attend my relaxation
        classes, workshops and other occasional events What I do with personal
        data The legal basis for processing your data is as follows: Contractual
        obligations in communicating therapy related information eg booking
        appointments, recording progress. Consent from individuals who
        participate in the CORP research programme, which tracks therapeutic
        progress. Legitimate interest in communicating information about
        relaxation classes, workshops, and other events. Legitimate interest for
        financial accounting purposes. Storage of personal data I hold data in
        both written and electric form. Written data collected: From
        individuals, if they enquire by telephone or text, in which case, I
        hand-write contact details and brief notes in order to make contact.
        From clients, during the Initial Consultation and subsequent therapy
        sessions. Written data is stored securely in a locked filing cabinet in
        my locked therapy room. Relevant data is transferred to electronic
        format for the purposes of recording attendance and bookkeeping.
        Electronic data is held in spreadsheets on a password-protected laptop.
        Client data is anonymised. For clients participating in the CORP
        research programme, I use the CORP specialist software to track client
        progress. Client data is anonymised before being stored in the CORP
        database. The anonymised CORP data is stored on my password-protected
        laptop and is periodically uploaded into a centralised ‘cloud’ of
        industry-wide data for research purposes. Electronic data is also held
        within a proprietary Email Management system for the purposes of
        notifying you of my events and opportunities that may be of interest.

        direct messages is held securely using leading service providers such as
        Facebook and Outlook, and is accessed via password-protected use
        accounts, mobile phones and laptops. Sharing your personal data Email
